I am a first year chemistry PhD student at the California Institute of Technology. 
I recently graduated Oberlin College with high honors in chemistry and minor in computer science. 
My interest lies in the area of physical and computational chemistry. I have a strong background in the application of quantum mechanical calculations to interrogate mechanisms behind various chemical phenomena including excited state properties and reaction mechanisms. Along with these efforts, I have also built a foundation for machine learning and application of AI-based methods to chemistry. Building on these past experiences, I would like to further broaden my scope to areas such as dynamic simulations as well as building a stronger foundation in the fundamental physics and physical chemistry to interpret and develop theoretical tools. 

A little bit about myself
======
I am originally from Hokkaido, Japan. I attended Hokkaido Interntional school and a nearby public Japanese school through elementary to highschool. In 2020, I began college at Oberlin College. Throughout my time in Oberlin College, I gained research experience in various fields of chemistry including computational photochemistry, computational organometallics, inorganic chemistry, and biochemistry. Through all of these experiences, I have reconfirmed my passion for chemistry and research. In my PhD, I hope to continue this journey by developing a deep expertise in computational/theoretical chemistry and improving my problem-solving ability in research.
